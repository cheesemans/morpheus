A component doc page is three files working together:

- `internal/site/page_<component>.templ` — the page: prose, playground, reference table, examples.
- `internal/site/examples/<name>.templ` (or `.html`) plus an optional sibling `<name>.css` — one example each.
- `internal/site/<component>_demo.go` — embeds the example sources and hands them to the page as playground states and demo frames.

The Templ parser gotchas in the `templ` skill apply to every `.templ` file here.

## Page structure

In order:

1. Title & general description (the intro)
2. Live playground
3. Reference
4. Examples
5. Examples: Datastar (if any)

## Prose

- Describe the **custom element**, never the Templ wrapper.
  - Document the HTML surface: attributes, child elements, events, `[data-neo-*]` hooks. Not the `@neo.*` / `datastar.*` helper.
  - Exception: an example specifically about a wrapper.
- Write tersely.
  - Non-obvious only; cut what states the obvious.
  - Plain simple technical English, as brief as possible.
  - One term per concept (trigger / listbox / popover), matching the element's own naming.
  - Structure with lists and formatting, not prose paragraphs; keep the text minimal.
  - Link, don't repeat. Describe shared behavior once, link to it elsewhere.
- Intro: opens with ``Component <code>{ "<neo-foo>" }</code> is …``.
- Example notes (`<p class="demo-note">` above each demo):
  - Say what it's for, then how it works.
  - No heading-as-prefix (`Disabled options: …`).
  - One point: a single `<p class="demo-note">`.
  - Several points: a lead `<p class="demo-note">` + a `<ul class="demo-note">` (never a one-item list).
  - Effect only visible through interaction? End with the action ("Type *xyz* to see it").
- Reference docs (`ComponentDoc` `Description`):
  - Never empty. If thin/obvious, link to the page it defers to (e.g. forwarded-to-`<neo-popover>` → Popover page).

## Examples

- One concept per `anchoredH3` demo; if a note needs "and also…", split it.
- Realistic data, never placeholders (`foo`, `Variant A`).

### Source layout

Each example is ONE self-contained templ function in `internal/site/examples/<name>.templ`. The `*_demo.go` renders it for the HTML tab and embeds the file verbatim for the Templ tab (`//go:embed examples/<name>.templ`); the page passes both as HTML source and Templ source and renders `@examples.X()` as the live preview. One source drives all three. Keep no separate `.html`, hard-coded `const` strings, or Go-built (string concat) HTML var for an example.

Indent example `.templ` files with TABS. The HTML-tab pretty-printer converts those tabs to two spaces; space indentation in the source yields ragged output.

### Self-sufficiency

Everything the Templ tab needs lives in that one embedded file. The test is visibility, not purity. The tab shows the whole file, so referencing code in ANOTHER file hides it from the reader.

Banned: a shared/cross-file templ helper, a factored-out style-string const, any cross-file markup or data helper (the only cross-package `@…` calls allowed are the `@neo.*` wrappers the example demonstrates).

Allowed (all visible in the same file): a helper templ func defined in this file (e.g. a recursive `templ treeNode(...)` for arbitrary-depth nesting, or a `templ.Component` value the wrapper API requires), a local type/data var, and `for` loops over inline data.

Prefer copying markup/CSS over factoring it out; reach for a same-file helper only when structure forces it (recursion, a component-valued option).

### Styling

An example's styling lives in one of two places: an inline `style` attribute on the element, or a sibling `.css` file.

A sibling `internal/site/examples/<name>.css` is embedded with `//go:embed` in `<component>_demo.go` and handed to the page as `PlaygroundState.CSS` or `DemoFrameOpts.CSSSource`. The site injects it as `<style>@scope { … }</style>` in the preview and shows it verbatim in the CSS tab. An inline `style` attribute needs no wiring and shows up in the HTML tab, where the element it styles is.

Extract to a sibling `.css` when one of these holds:

- The rule cannot be inlined: a descendant or child selector, a pseudo-class, an at-rule, or a custom property that has to cascade to a descendant.
- It removes duplication of a substantive block — roughly three or more declarations repeated across elements in one example, or across several states of one playground.

Otherwise keep it inline. A one- or two-declaration tweak (`width: 22rem`, `font-size: 3rem`, `margin: 0`) does not justify a class plus a file, even when it repeats.

Requirement: never put a `<style>` block in an example. Example CSS lives in light DOM, so an unscoped rule leaks page-wide and silently styles other demos. `examples/scope_test.go` fails the build on an unscoped block in a `.templ`.

Dynamic values stay inline. A `data-attr:style` binding and the server-rendered value it patches are data, not styling:

	<span
	  class="color-field-morph-swatch"
	  style="background: #2563eb"
	  data-attr:style="'background: ' + $cf_morph_value"
	></span>

The class carries the box metrics; the inline declaration carries the bound value.

Writing the `.css` file:

- One file per example, named after it (`popover_morph.css` beside `popover_morph_*.html`). States that share one block share one embedded var (`popoverMorphCSS`).
- Class names are kebab-case and prefixed with the example slug: `.popover-morph-panel`, `.skeleton-morph-avatar`.
- Tab-indented, one blank line between rules.
- Classes defined in `internal/site/static/style.css` already apply to previews. Use them instead of copying their rules into an example's CSS.

## Playgrounds

New or migrated overview pages use the reusable `Playground` Templ component (`internal/site/playground.templ`), driven by the site-only `<site-playground>` controller (`web/site/site-playground.ts`). No per-page playground scripts, simulator routes, or one-off editors.

- The first state is named `Default`. Other states reuse the real examples already on the page, with no placeholders like `Variant A`.
- Each state's HTML is the single source for both its preview and the CodeMirror document. Don't add a separate parameter schema or duplicate the preview markup in the template.
- State HTML is trusted, repository-authored. The editor runs only in the browser; never persist or send edited HTML to a server.
- Declare editable signals as a Datastar object expression in `data-signals` (double-quoted attribute, unquoted keys, single-quoted strings: `data-signals="{foo_bar: 1, baz: 'x'}"`), and drive the markup with normal Datastar bindings. Controls handle scalar string, number, boolean, and null. Namespace signal names to the component/page.
- Two-way binding a boolean-command attribute (`checked`, `pressed`, `open`) needs the command-string form plus a synchronous write-back, not a bare boolean: `data-attr:checked="$sig ? 'true' : 'false'"` with `data-on:neo-<tag>-change="$sig = evt.detail.checked"`. A bare `data-attr:checked="$sig"` makes Datastar remove the attribute on `false`, which the component reads as "no command, keep current state" (DESIGN.md Attribute Contract), so the control snaps back and stays visually on until a second interaction. Canonical examples: `checkbox_default.html`, `sidebar_default.html`.
- The controller owns state selection, reordering, enable/disable, duplication, autoplay, renaming, resizing, mobile options, and code/signal editing. Keep the template declarative; don't reimplement these.
- Leave the preview height unset so it tracks the active state's content. Set `PlaygroundOpts.Height` only when the component needs a fixed canvas.
